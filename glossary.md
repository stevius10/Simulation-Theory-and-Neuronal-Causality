# Glossary

### Artificial Neural Network
A computational model inspired by the human brain, composed of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process information. Artificial neural networks are commonly used in machine learning and artificial intelligence to recognize patterns, make decisions, and model complex systems. In this project, neural networks are considered both as computational structures and as potential counterparts to biological neural networks.

### Causality
The principle that every effect has a specific cause, creating a chain of events where each outcome is determined by preceding actions. In this project, causality is explored in the context of both real and simulated environments, examining whether causal structures in a simulation might align with or diverge from those observed in perceived reality.

### Convergence
The process by which two or more systems, structures, or principles become more similar or aligned over time. Here, convergence refers to the potential alignment between simulated causality and the causal structures we observe in neural networks and human cognition.

### Determinism
The philosophical view that all events are determined by previously existing causes, making every event predictable if the initial conditions are known. In the context of Simulation Theory, determinism raises questions about whether simulated environments could achieve a form of causality that is strictly determined or probabilistic.

### Emergence
A phenomenon where complex systems and patterns arise from the interactions of simpler elements. Emergence is relevant to this project in exploring how complex causal patterns might arise within neural networks or simulated environments, potentially giving rise to consciousness-like structures.

### Entanglement
A concept in quantum mechanics where particles become interdependent in such a way that the state of one particle instantly affects the state of another, regardless of distance. Entanglement is relevant to the idea of interconnected realities within a simulation, where changes in one part of the system may directly impact another.

### Many-Worlds Interpretation
An interpretation of quantum mechanics proposing that all possible outcomes of a quantum event exist simultaneously in separate, parallel realities. This concept is explored in relation to Simulation Theory, suggesting that multiple outcomes could be realized within a simulated environment.

### Neuronal Causality
The idea that causality is structured within neural networks, both biological and synthetic, in a way that defines cognitive processes and decision-making. This project posits that neuronal causality could serve as a foundational model for understanding causality within simulated environments.

### Non-Linear Causality
A form of causality where effects do not follow a direct, linear relationship to their causes, often resulting in complex, unpredictable outcomes. Non-linear causality is of interest in this project as it relates to the potential complexity and unpredictability of events in both simulated and experiential realities.

### Perceived Reality
The subjective experience of reality as it is perceived by an individual. This concept contrasts with the notion of an objectively "true" reality and is relevant in examining how a simulation could create experiences indistinguishable from those of perceived reality.

### Probability Wave
A mathematical function in quantum mechanics that describes the likelihood of a particle's position and state. The concept of a probability wave is relevant to Simulation Theory in exploring how probabilities and potential outcomes might be managed within a simulated environment.

### Quantum Mechanics
A fundamental theory in physics describing the behavior of matter and energy at atomic and subatomic scales. Quantum mechanics introduces concepts like superposition and entanglement, which challenge traditional notions of causality and are relevant in the exploration of simulation.

### Simulation Theory
The hypothesis that our perceived reality could be an artificial simulation, potentially created by an advanced intelligence or by future generations. This theory raises questions about the nature of existence, consciousness, and the structure of causality within a simulated universe.

### Superposition
A principle in quantum mechanics where a particle exists simultaneously in multiple states until it is observed. Superposition is often discussed in relation to parallel realities and is relevant in exploring whether multiple outcomes could exist concurrently within a simulated environment.

### Time Reversal (Inverse Time)
A concept suggesting that time's direction could be reversed under certain conditions, allowing events to unfold in reverse order. Within this project, time reversal is considered as a potential phenomenon in simulated environments, raising questions about the fluidity and structure of causality.

### Uncertainty Principle
A concept in quantum mechanics introduced by Werner Heisenberg, which states that it is impossible to know both the position and momentum of a particle with absolute precision. This principle implies inherent limitations to knowledge within physical systems, relevant to the simulation hypothesis in terms of the limits of predictability within simulated realities.
