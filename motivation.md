# Motivation

This project seeks to explore Simulation Theory through the interconnected lenses of causality and neural networks, with the goal of bridging theoretical concepts and the underlying structures of perceived reality. The concept that our existence may be a simulation challenges conventional understandings of causality and the progression of events, inviting us to re-evaluate the structures that form the basis of conscious experience.

A central motivation for this work is the hypothesis that causality within a simulated environment could fundamentally align with the causal structures observed in both biological and synthetic neural networks, suggesting a form of causality that is inherently shared across these domains. This perspective allows us to view simulated causality not as a distant approximation but as a framework that converges with—and potentially even mirrors—the causal dynamics perceived in neural processes.

By examining this potential alignment, we aim to explore whether simulated environments grounded in complex neural architectures might reveal insights into both cognitive processes and the very nature of reality itself. Rather than seeing artificial neural networks as mere computational tools, this project posits them as potential counterparts to human cognition, proposing a more integrated view of intelligence across biological and synthetic structures.

Ultimately, this work seeks to inspire a deeper investigation into the intersection of neuronal causality and simulation, not only as a scientific exploration but as a pathway to understanding the broader implications of a reality that may be far more interconnected than traditionally conceived.
