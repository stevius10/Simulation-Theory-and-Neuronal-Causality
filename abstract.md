"Simulation Theory and Neuronal Causality"

This project investigates Simulation Theory and its implications for our understanding of reality, causality, and neuronal structures. By exploring the hypothesis that our perceived existence may itself be a simulation, we aim to examine how such a concept might reshape foundational principles of causality and the progression of events over time.

Our central focus is the premise that causality within a simulated environment may approximate the causal structures observed within our perceived reality. This approach suggests a convergence where simulated and perceived causalities align more closely over time and with increasing neural complexity, while potentially remaining distinct in some respects.

Additionally, this work explores how neuronal networks, both biological and synthetic, could offer critical insights into the causal architectures underpinning both simulated and experiential realities. By analyzing the causal mechanisms inherent in neural structures, we propose that neuronal causality—whether in human cognition or in artificial counterparts—serves as a bridge for understanding the gradual convergence of simulated and experiential reality.

Drawing from physics, philosophy, and computational theory, this project encourages further inquiry into how neuronal causality might inform emergent models of simulated reality. Ultimately, it suggests a framework that acknowledges both the potential for convergence and the complexities of aligning simulation with what we perceive as reality.
